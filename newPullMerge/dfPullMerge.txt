Git Pull

The git pull command first runs git fetch which downloads content from the specified remote repository.
 Then a git merge is executed to merge the remote content refs and heads into a new local merge commit. 
The git pull command is used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately 
update the local repository to match that content. Merging remote upstream changes into your local repository 
is a common task in Git-based collaboration work flows.
 The git pull command is actually a combination of two other commands, git fetch followed by git merge.

Git Merge

Git merge will combine multiple sequences of commits into one unified history. In the most frequent use cases, git merge is used to combine two branches. The following examples in this document will focus on this branch merging pattern. In these scenarios, git merge takes two commit pointers, usually the branch tips, and will find a common base commit between them. Once Git finds a common base commit it will create a new "merge commit" that combines the changes of each queued merge commit sequence.
